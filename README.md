# Overview of analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. Once we run our queries we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the .describe() method.

# Results

 -- In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

 -- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 -- making a .5 difference in the two different seasons

# Summary 

Analysis of the two months, June and December show that the average temperature through the years 2010 and 2016 was above 70 degrees. The minimum temperature remained above the mid '50's. Additional queries of the last year, 2016, for the month of Decemember indicate the December 24th & 25th were in the high seventies. Additionally out of the 31 days in the month of December, 22 days were above 75 degrees. Since June is known for being a warm weather month and December traditionally a colder month. The two additional queries of the month of December indicate that the weather would be suited for an all year round surf shop.
