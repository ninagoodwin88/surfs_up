# Overview of analysis
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. Once we run our queries we store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe. Once our dataframe is created we are able to get our summary statistics by using the .describe() method.

# Results

 -- In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0
